# Comments_Access_Manager
Piwigo plugin - Manage comment's permissions for your gallery

Modify comments permissions for your gallery:
- When "Comments for all" is enabled, everyone can comment - they only need a nickname.
- When "Comments for all" is disabled, only a select group of users may comment.

Very simple to use :
1- Install the plugin into your Piwigo gallery
2- Go to plugin's settings page.
  * If comments for all visitors are disabled in your Piwigo settings, you'll be able to set comments permissions for a users group.
  * If comments for all visitors are enabled in your Piwigo settings, you'll be able to force a nickname to be set before a comment is submitted

  * If an admin validation is set on comments submit, you'll be able to exclude a given users group from validation behavior
